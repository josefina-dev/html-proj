<h2>Hey there!</h2>
<p>You might be one of the aspiring web developers,like me! But can't afford to buy a new laptop, and all you got is your ipad.
No worries! As i searched through internet i found that you can still use your ipad to build your html text. I just don't know 
yet if you can deploy websites using ipad. If this thing pushes throug github then probably yes.<br/>

Ipad can't download visual studio code app so it was suggested to download/purchase Code App on your app store (this is what im currently using) and works almost the same with VSC.<br/>
Try it Now! and be a web developer!<br/>
